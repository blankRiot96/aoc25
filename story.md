### Day 1
Basically, every year the elves have some kind of christmas emergency 😭<br>
But this year, the elves discovered project management (gasp). <br>
They learn that the North Pole decorations needs to be completed quickly cause other important stuff needs to start on time <br>
<br>
**But**!! No elf is left to decorate the North Pole :c<br>
So it's up to you!! <br>
<br>
You arrive at the North Pole base ready to start decorating it, but apparently the password to enter has been changed, and it is in a safe... but fear not, because you can unlock the base (password to find the password... sigh) by following some instructions you found which ask you to turn the nob a couple of times and see how many times the pointer passes through <ins>zero</ins><br>

### Day 2
You finally make it inside the base and ride an elevator to its only stop: The Gift Shop!<br>
Through there, you can reach the lobby, through which you can get to all the places in the north pole base.<br>
However, the gift shop clerk finds you and asks for your help! An elf kid messed around with the computer and fucked it all up. There are a BUNCH of invalid product IDs. Luckily, the clerk and his team already started listing the ranges where the invalid product IDs could exist!<br>
<br>
You just need to go through them and check for invalid IDs: If the ID is a number which is kinda like, a palindrome, but not really. It's a number that can be made by repeating one number twice. Like 1212 can be made by repeating 12
